I got bored so i made this...

#1: Use if you have a command handler

If you have a bot command handler create a new event called message.js! Then do the export line and after that do the program! 
If you do not know what the export line is it is what starts the command. Mine looks like this: module.exports = (client, message) => {
I put it at the very start of the code after that paste the code right after it and then finish it! This will make every command done 
be Case Sensitive!

#2: If the code is on the 1 main file do this! (I dont reccomend that cause your bot gets all glitchy i would learn a command handler if i 
was you)

If the code is on 1 line after you do the Call Packages lines and right after you do the client.on("message", (message) => { line right 
a line down paste the program and then do your files! The line of code also makes it so the bot cant activate i'ts own commands because if
your command was 

if (message.content.includes("Ping")) {
message.channel.send("You said "Ping" so i say Pong!);

As you see the bots message includes Ping so the bot will activate its own command! so the "if (message.author.bot) return;" makes
it so the bot cant activate its own command and cause a massive raid of 5 messages per second!

That is it for this bye!
